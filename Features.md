# ESNext Features to Support in CoffeeScript

Per the [README](./README.md), we have two main goals for the future of CoffeeScript: adding support for important ES2015+ (ESNext) features that CoffeeScript currently lacks, and changing CoffeeScript’s output to be ESNext code. See also the [project board for CoffeeScript 2.0.0](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/projects/1).

Features are ordered by priority, which is determined (subjectively) by how important each feature is to the CoffeeScript community. The most important criterion is whether the lack of specific feature affects CoffeeScript’s viability for a potential project: if a developer must choose between CoffeeScript and a particular library or framework, whatever missing feature is causing that choice to need to be made is a top priority for us to fix. This list is based on the [issues](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues) for this repo and the discussion in [#8](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/8).

## Top Priority

These features affect interopability and should take priority over all other features. These should be implemented ASAP in the current compiler, in addition to any new compiler that gets created later.

### Modules: `import` and `export` [(#7)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/7)

> CoffeeScript 1.x and 2

[This has been merged](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/pull/4300) and released as part of CoffeeScript 1.11.

### Classes [(#22)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/22)

> CoffeeScript 2 only

As part of CoffeeScript 2, we will revise CoffeeScript’s `class` syntax to be compatible with ECMAScript’s `class`; this means no code in class bodies, no using `this` in a constructor before calling `super`, etc. We try to keep as many features of the CoffeeScript `class` as possible while still ouputting the ECMAScript `class` keyword, so that we can extend ES classes and create extendable native classes. Getters and setters [(#17)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/17) would probably be implemented as part of supporting ES classes. This is in progress at [jashkenas/coffeescript #4330](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/pull/4330).

### Tagged template literals [(#28)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/28)

> CoffeeScript 1.x and 2

Some new libraries require support for ECMAScript template literals, which are incompatible with CoffeeScript’s backticks. Support would be added for `myTag"hello #{'wo'+'rld'}"` or `myTag"""some multiline string"""`. Such syntax is currently not allowed in CoffeeScript, so enabling support for it would not be a breaking change.

## Medium Priority

These features aren’t required for CoffeeScript to be used in any project, but there’s great desire in the community for these to be added.

### `async`/`await` [(#10)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/10)

> CoffeeScript 2

[This has been merged](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/pull/3757) into the `2` branch.

### Backticked blocks [(#42)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/42)

> CoffeeScript 1.x and 2

Like triple quotes `"""` or `'''`, triple backticks ```` ``` ```` would delineate a block of passthrough JavaScript code. This would enable template literals to work within backticked blocks, and also provide a way to passthrough JavaScript code that might itself contain backticks (such as in Markdown comments, or in ES2015 template literals).

## Low Priority

These are nice-to-have features that should be implemented as time permits, probably only in the “new” compiler if one gets created. Any change that causes ES2015 output and isn’t opt-in needs to either be enabled by a flag or only in the new, ESNext-outputting compiler.

### Template literals [(#41)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/41)

> CoffeeScript 2 only

Output CoffeeScript’s interpolated strings—`"hello, #{name}!"`—as ES2015 template literals: `` `hello, ${name}!` ``

### Fat arrows `=>` output as `=>` [(#8)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/8)

> CoffeeScript 2 only

[This has been merged](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/pull/4311) into the `2` branch.

### Destructuring assignment [(#18)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/18)

> CoffeeScript 2 only

### `for … of` [(#11)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/11)

> CoffeeScript 2 only

[This is almost complete.](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/pull/4306)

## Uncertain

These are features we’re not sure we will implement, in any version of CoffeeScript:

### Inferred `let` assignment [(#1)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/1)

> CoffeeScript 2 only

When a variable isn’t declared using the new operator that produces `const` (see above), CoffeeScript should automatically declare it with `let` whenever possible.

### Block assignment `let` and `const` assignment operators [(#31)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/31) or [(#35)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/35)

> CoffeeScript 2 only

For whatever reason, `let` and `const` are among the most popular features introduced by ES2015. Awaiting consensus on which of these two proposals we want to adopt, if either. Per [#1](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/1), there seems to be consensus that we want some way to support `const` and probably `let` in CoffeeScript.

If we support `const` only, [(#31)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/31), a new `:=` operator would be added, e.g. `a := 1` would become `const a = 1;`. This would give us the “throw an error if a `const`-declared variable is reassigned” feature of `const`, plus block-scoping but only for `const`s.

If we support `let` and `const`, [(#35)](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/35), which would be necessary if we want to gain the block-scope aspects of the new `let` and `const` keywords, we would need two new operators: `:=` for `let` and `:==` for `const`. The `:=`-defined variables would get their `let` declarations grouped together at the tops of their blocks.

## No Action

These are other features that have been discussed, but the consensus at the moment is that no action should be taken to implement them.
